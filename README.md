# JS Tic-Tac-Toe with Rails API

We've provided a Rails API backend to persist our game data, all that's left is building out the front-end functionality using JavaScript!

For reference, [here's the video](http://flatiron-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/Learn%20Curriculum%20Helpers/ttt.mov) showing how the final product should function. (Right-click and `Save Link As...` to download.)

## Objectives
- Create a fully-functional tic-tac-toe game using JavaScript.
- Make fetch requests to a Rails API in order to save, update, and reload games.

## Getting started
Code your solution in `app/assets/javascripts/tictactoe.js`, which we're loading via the Rails asset pipeline. As a refresher, we added that file to the asset pipeline by specifying `//= require tictactoe` in our JavaScript manifest file (`app/assets/javascripts/application.js`).

You should not have to create any new files or modify anything outside of `tictactoe.js`.

### Exploring the DOM
The only view our application requires lives in `app/views/home/index.html`. Before you dive into writing JavaScript, start the Rails server and familiarize yourself with the DOM that you'll be working with. Take special note of the way in which the squares of the game board are identified with `data-x` and `data-y` attributes.

### Buttons!

#### `button#save`
Clicking this button should save the current game state. If the current game already exists in the database, saving it should update that previously-saved game. If the current game has not yet been persisted to the database, saving it should do so. As a brief example, if we start with a blank board that has not been saved and click `button#save`, the current game should be persisted to our database. If we then click `button#save` a second time, the persisted game should be updated (though, since we have yet to make any moves, the board will still be blank in the updated game state).

#### `button#previous`
Clicking this button should grab all of the persisted games from the database and create a button for each that, when clicked, returns that saved game's state to our tic-tac-toe board. All of the buttons should be added to the `div#games` element in the DOM.

#### `button#clear`
Clicking this button should clear the game board and start _a completely new game_. If we click `button#save`, then `button#clear`, and then `button#save` again, _two_ games should have been persisted to the database.

## Conjunction junction, what's your function?
For the actual TTT functionality, there is no test suite provided. We've given you a lot of the structure, and the "TODO" comments should guide you in the right direction for getting the game to work.
- `player()`
  + Returns the token of the player whose turn it is, `'X'` when the `turn` variable is even and `'O'` when it is odd.
- `updateState()`
  + Invokes `player()` and adds the returned string (`'X'` or `'O'`) to the clicked square on the game board.
- `setMessage()`
  + Accepts a string and adds it to the `div#message` element in the DOM.
- `checkWinner()`
  + Returns `true` if the current board contains any winning combinations (three `X` or `O` tokens in a row, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally). Otherwise, returns `false`.
  + If there is a winning combination on the board, `checkWinner()` should invoke `setMessage()`, passing in the appropriate string based on who won: `'Player X Won!'` or `'Player O Won!'`
- `doTurn()`
  + Increments the `turn` variable by `1`.
  + Invokes the `updateState()` function, passing it the element that was clicked.
  + Invokes `checkWinner()` to determine whether the move results in a winning play.
- `attachListeners()`
  + Attaches the appropriate event listeners to the squares of the game board as well as for the `button#save`, `button#previous`, and `button#clear` elements.
  + When a user clicks on a square on the game board, the event listener should invoke `doTurn()` and pass it the element that was clicked.
  + ***NOTE***: `attachListeners()` _must_ be invoked *after* the DOM content is loaded. 

## Bonus(es)
1. Once you have a functionally awesome / awesomely functional tic-tac-toe game with persistence, try refactoring your front-end to use ES6 `class`es and other OO design patterns. Think about the domain you're trying to model â€” how many classes do you need? What are the relationships between classes?
2. Implement a [memoization](https://www.sitepoint.com/implementing-memoization-in-javascript/) scheme for minimizing the amount of database calls your application makes.
3. Modify the `GameSerializer` to include the `updated_at` attribute, and display the last-updated time next to each saved game in the DOM.
